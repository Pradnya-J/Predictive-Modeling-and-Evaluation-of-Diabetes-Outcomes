# Predictive-Modeling-and-Evaluation-of-Diabetes-Outcomes
Description:

- Developed a comprehensive diabetes prediction model using multiple classification techniques including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

- Conducted data preprocessing by handling outliers with winsorization, scaling features with standardization, and evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

- Visualized key metrics and results through heatmaps and distribution plots to ensure robust model performance and insights into diabetes diagnosis.
